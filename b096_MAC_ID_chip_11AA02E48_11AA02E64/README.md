## difference between a MAC and EUI-48
The subtle difference between EUI-48 and MAC-48 was not well understood; as a result, the term MAC-48 is now obsolete and the term EUI-48 is used for both (but the terms “MAC” and “MAC address” are still used).

In other words, EUI-48 and the MAC number of a device represent the same thing! Usually it is represented in 12 hex (e.g. 0023.a34e.abc9), equivalent to 48 bits or 6 bytes.

## connectability
Most microcontroller boards are not going to have a osf.B021 connector. This connector is however compatible with SPI, I2C, GPIO and many others. 

## tests
untested.
