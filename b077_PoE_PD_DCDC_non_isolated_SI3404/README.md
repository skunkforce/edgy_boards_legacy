# b077 PoE PD DCDC non isolated

# tests
The b077v0.1 board was connected to the center taps connector of a b078v0.1 board connected to a PoE switch (Netgear GS108PP). 5v was measured with an oscilliscope on the output with 5ma load. There was roughly 20mv of rippele on the output of 5.4V. This is as expected.
There were some issues discussed in pull request #67 which were resolved with wire. The next version will most likely be a release.
